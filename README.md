Platooning package for Turtlebot 3. Created during bachelor project at Aalborg University.

To use this software, a Turtlebot 3 must be used and assembled according to the e-manual provided by Robotis (http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/). Furthermore, To be able to use the python scripts included here, these must be made into executables. This can be done by running the following commands in the terminal from the location of the files:
